# Ignored flake8 rules
#
# E203 - Colons should not have any space before them (https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E203.html).
#        Ignoring this can make some code more readable.
# E501 - Line length should be less than 79 chars (https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E501.html).
#        We don't need flake8 to check this as black determines line formatting.
# F541 - f-strings without any placeholders (https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html).
# W391 - There should be one, and only one, blank line at the end of each file (https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W391.html).
# W503 - Line breaks should occur after the binary operator to keep all variable names aligned (https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W503.html).
# W504 - Line breaks should occur before the binary operator to keep all operators aligned (https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W504.html)
